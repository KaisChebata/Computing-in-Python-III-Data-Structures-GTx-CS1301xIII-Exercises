#Last problem, you implemented a function that could find if
#someone had won a particular game of tic-tac-toe based on a
#2D tuple representing the current game board.
#
#In this problem, you'll do the same thing, but for Connect
#4 instead of tic-tac-toe. Write another function called
#check_winner which takes as input a 2D list. It should
#return "X" if there are four adjacent "X" values anywhere
#in the list (row, column, diagonal); "O" if there are four
#adjacent "O" values anywhere in the list; and None if
#there are neither.
#
#Here are the ways Connect-4 is different from tic-tac-toe:
#
# - Connect-4 is played with 6 rows and 7 columns, not 3
#   rows and 3 columns.
# - You must have 4 in a row (or column or diagonal) to win
#   instead of 3.
# - You may only place pieces in the bottom-most empty
#   space in a column (e.g. you "drop" the pieces in the
#   column and they fall to the first empty spot). Note,
#   though, that this shouldn't affect your reasoning.
#
#To keep things simple, we'll still use "X" and "O" to
#represent the players, and None to represent empty spots.
#You may make the same assumptions as the previous
#problem: only one winner per board, no characters besides
#"X", "O", and None, and you don't have to worry about
#whether the board is actually a valid game of Connect 4.
#
#Hints:
# - Don't forget both kinds of diagonals!
# - This board is too large to check every possible place
#   for a winner: there are 69 places a player could win.
# - Remember, if you put a negative index in a list,
#   Python "wraps around" and checks the last value. You
#   may have to control for this.


#Write your function here!

#a 2D tuple; they're used here just for readability.
